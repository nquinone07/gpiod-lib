 + Description : The code contained in this mini        +
 + project is aimed at exercising gpios in userland     +
 + with whatever tooling (e.g. memmap, libgpiod, etc.). +
 + Ultimately the goal is write either a kernel/user    +
 + space driver for gpios.                              +
 +                                                      +
